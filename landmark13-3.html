<tr><td><font size=4>The 1st and 2nd quarters represent the atheists and agnostics.<br><br>
There are non-believing Godless people (Big bang Theory - you gotta be kidding).  Atheists are rebellious to people who have a belief in God.  Agnostics are skeptics and doubters and try to intellectualize God's existence. Neither will accept the Bible as a basis for spiritual authority.  They live their lives on their own will and their own power.<br><br>
The 3rd quarter incorporates many spiritual dimensions.  There are all kinds of people who believe in God. However, theri God or Gods are very different and are reflected by the many relidions of the world.  These people believe in their God, but have no personal relationship with him.<br><br>
There are those in Christian faith who believe in God as revealed through his son Jesus Christ.  Their faith is based on teachings of the Hold Bible and they worship regularly or irregulary in churches, large gatherings and small groups.  Most of the have only a formal or ritual relationship with Jesus.  They are living on their own will trying to use Chris't power.<br><br>
The 4th quarter is the final quarter when the game is on the line.  Christians who are in this quarter have a deep faith though their personal belief and relationship with Jesus Christ.  They have let go of their EGO's and their own power to a power greater than themselves. They experience a peace, power and joy that passes all understanding (Phil 4:6-7)<br><center><u>THIS IS TOTAL RELEASE</u></center><br>
All of us are in one of these foru spiritual quarters in our lives.  We need to look at the bottom border of our own I.D. Card and ask ourselves which quarter are we in?  Why are we there?<br><br>
Now read Wes Neal's TOTAL RELEASE PERFORMANCE and see how your personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ can positively affect your life and your athletic performance XXL!<br><br></font></td></tr>
