<tr><td><font size=4><center><u>MY INNER GAME (HEAD - HEART - SPIRIT)</u></center><br>
<center><u>I DISCOVER MY POTENTIAL ONLY WHEN I BECOME MOTIVATED</u></center><Br>
<u>Motivation</u> gives <u>direction</u> and <u>intensity</u> to my <u>efforts</u> and <u>behavior</u>.  My M/Q (motivation quotient), not my I/Q (intelligence quotient), is what closes the <u>GAP</u> in my <u>HIGH-LEVEL POTENITAL PERFORMANCE</u>.  I must realize that I have been conditioned by my past experiences which many times limit my performance.  I must remember that God created us in HIS own images (Gen 1:27).  We have potenital that we haven't dreamed of.  Our human brain alone has the capacity of more than five giant computers . . .<br><Br>
<Center>Remeber, <u>GOD MADE ME AND HE DOESN'T MAKE JUNK!</u></center><br>
I BECOME MOTIVATED ONLY WHEN I AM STRIVING FOR MY DESIRES THOUGH GOAL-SETS.  <u>Desires attained through goal settting are the single strongest force in teh development of self-motivation.</u>  <u>The bigger the callenge, the more I can stretch my potential.</u>  Whe I accept a <u>challenge</u>, I start to use and develop potential that I didn't realize I had.  The real excitement and fulfillment in my life is in the <u>building of desires</u> and the <u>accomplishment</u> of <u>goal-sets in the attainment of them.</u><br><br>
<center><u>THE TRUE PEAK PERFORMER HAS THE DESIRE FOR EXCELLENCE AND IS WILLING TO EXTEND HIMSELF IN THE PROCESS.</u></center><br>
<u>I START RESPONDING TO MY DESIRES AND GOAL-SETS WHEN I BEGIN PUSHING THE POSITIVE BUTTONS IN MYSELF AND OTHERS . . . THE REAL POWER IN ANY TEAM OR GROUP IS PUTTING UP EACH OTHER</u> - The genuine belief that we are going to bring out the best in each other and the genuine pride in each other's performance.  (BOBEO).  JESUS CHRIST, OUR MASTER COACH, IS THE GREATEST MOTIVATOR OF ALL TIME.  He believed in his Creator, Himself, and He believed in teh potenital of each human being.  That's why HE has inspired more people than anyone else in history to become their very best and continue to give it their best shot in the <Br><br>
<center><u>BIGGEST GAME OF ALL - THE GAME OF LIFE.</u></center><br>
TOTAL RELEASE PREFORMANCE IS THE REALIZATION THAT I AM REPRESENTING A POWER GREATER THAN MYSELF THROUGH OUR LORD AND SAVIOR, JESUS CHIRST (1 John 4:4).  <u>GREATER IS HE WHO IS IN ME THAN HE WHO IS IN THE WORLD.</u>  THIS GIVES ME A PEACE - POWER - ANY JOY THAT PASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING (Phil 4:6-7).  WOW!! This allows me to perform at my peak performance more often - AND - <u>MOMENTUM JOINS OUR TEAM!!</u><BR><br></font></td></tr>
