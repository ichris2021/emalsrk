<tr><td><br><font size=4>We need to start to build desires in these areas and then GOAL SET to reach them.  We should focus on one or two at a time making sure they are all compatible with each other.  Some are short while others are long range, and some are a reflection of needs while others are wants -- both of these are important.  As we begin to form the habit of doing this a new confidence and enthusiasm will emerge.<br><br>
In our EMAL Football Program we have 4 key categories to build our desires and Goal Sets on.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>1 - BLUE CAR ATTITUDE</b><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>2 - SKILLS AND SYSTEMS</b><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>3 - FITNESS</b><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>4 - TEAM BUILDING</b><br><br>
Read over the Basic Desire-Goal Set list for each, add any others of your own and then</font><br><br>
<font size=4 color=blue><center><b>HIT YOUR HOT BUTTON AND START TO GO FOR EM!</b></center></font>
<font size=4><Br>You revise and renew these each week.  During the season you turn these in and get feedback from your coaches to further motivate you.  You also have a teammate to help you be accountable.  During the summer try to get someone to feedback to you and keep you accountable.  You dad, mom, brother, friend, teammate.</font><br><br>
