<font size=5><center>"The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life.  Attitude, to me, is more important than facts.  It is more important than physical appearance, intelligence or skill.  It will make or break an athletic team, an organization, a business, a church or a home.  The remarkable thing is that we have a choice every day regarding the attitude that we will embrace for that day.  We cannot change the regrets of the past nor do we need to fear the events of the future.  Regret and fear are twin thieves who would rob us of the only thing we have control over
<center>- that is today</center>
We need to learn to go into the arena every day with a winning attitude and enjoy the challenges it brings.  I am convinced that life is 20% of what happens to us and 80% how we react to it."</font>
