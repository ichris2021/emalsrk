<tr><Td align=left><font size=4>There is a classic story about how Satan wanted to destroy humanity and rule the world.  He called in his cheif assistants.  Anger spoke first.  "Let me go;  I will set brother against brother, sister against sister, man against woman and woman against man.  I will get them all angry at each other and they will destroy themselves."
<br><br>
Next spoke Lust.  "I will corrupt human minds.  I will make genuine love disappear and turn them into beastly creatures."  Greed then stated, "Allow me to go and I will instill in human hearts the most destructive of all passions.  Humans' uncontrolled desires will destroy them."
<br><br>
The twins, Gluttony and Drunkenness stood up and sid how they could make human bodies weak and their minds distorted, making them easy victims.  Envy, Jealousy, and Hate explained how each of them could destroy humanity.  Idleness also claimed he could do the job.
<br><br>
Satan wasn't satisfied with any of these.  Finally, his last assistant stood up and said, "Let me go and do it.  I shall talk to humans about all that God wanted each of them to be.  I shall tell them how find these plans are -- to be caring, sharing, faithful and full of hope.  To each on I shall talk of the many good purposes of life."
<br><br>
Satan could not believe what he had heard.  But his assistant continued, "I shall tell them, however, there is <u>no hurry</u>;  they should <u>really</u> do their own thing.  They can do all of those other things <u>tomorrow</u>.  I shall advise them to wait...wait until conditions become more favorable before they start."  He then disclosed to Satan that humanity really doesn't know that -- <u>the road to Hell is paved with good intentions</u>.
<br><br>
Satan's eyes lit up.  "You are the one -- You shall go and destroy humanity."  The chosen one's name was <u>Procrastination</u>.  He is the one who will convince humanity to put off those Godly things and good intentions awhile longer.  And as they do, without their knowing it, Satan and his forces will take control of the world.
