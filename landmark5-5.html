<font size=4>
The enemy I had, I didn't even know.<br>
He followed me unseen, wherever I would go.<br><br>
He blocked my plans, he blocked my way,<br>
He countered me, even before I could say.<br><br>
Each time I would make the effort to try,<br>
He made me afraid, so I'd let things pass by.<br><br>
One night I caught him and grabbed for his mask;<br>
I wanted to see, I wanted to ask.<br><br>
But to my amazement as I looked at his face,<br>
It was me that I saw, and I prayed for GOD'S GRACE.<br><br>
The enemy who had been hiding inside,<br>
I finally let go of, and the enemy died.<br><br>
My new friend inside shares an exciting new way:<br>
He says "YES WE CAN" as we start out each day.<br><br>
Our SPIRIT in life is the KEY TO IT ALL.<br>
Our BELIEF deep inside picks us up when we fall.<br><br>
I can run LIFE'S RACE with a CALM INNER PEACE.<br>
I GO FOR IT NOW WITH TOTAL RELEASE.</font><br><Br></td></tr>
