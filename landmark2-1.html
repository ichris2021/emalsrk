Before you get in your Blue Car, notice there are some small white rocks near you.  Pick up some of them and put them in your leather pouch.  This may seem a trivial thing to do, but believe me, it is important as you will see later on your trip.<br>

Now get in your car with your map open beside you.  Snap on your seat belt, turn the key, start your engine, shift into drive and begin your trip.  Stop at each <u>designated landmark</u> and find the <u>SRK</u>.  Remember to look and really see, read and really understand, and then put this powerful knowledge into action in your own life.  As you leave each landmark, pick up some rocks and put them into your leather pouch, then proceed.
