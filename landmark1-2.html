<font size=4>The model of winning that the vast majority of people know is the <u>war model</u>.  That is, defeat your opponent and you become the conqueror, the winner, a success.  Lose to your opponent and you become the conquered, the loser, a failure.  In the Success Race, this is commonly known as the Red Model of Winning.  The Red Model Car drives you on a road to winning -- the so-called Road to Success.  It is a highly visible road that is all around us.  The Red Car travels on this road to the success place wherever it may be.  The road sign says -- this is the way to win <u>the Success Race</u>.  In sports, the professional teams to the little leagues, have bought into this model.  In the business world the corporate to small entrepreneurs have also.  In fact it appears that anyone who is a competitor believes this is the only model of winning.  It is what we see,hear and read about all the time.  In essence it says <u>you are either #1 or no one</u>.  The amazing thing about this Red Model of winning, is that in reality it has produced very few winners, that is people who think and feel good about themselves in the competitive arena and in their daily lives.  The reason for this is that the Red Model Car is powered by the highly competitive emphasis on comparing oneself to others, the belief that there is only one winner and you only win when you defeat someone or everyone.  The Red Car on its road to success encounters many negative situations along the way including tension, anxiety, fear and regret.  These rob people of the real joy of competitive experience and undermine confidence and self image.  We do see celebrations by victorious teams, individuals and those who win the #1 or no one game.  They have arrived at the SUCCESS PLACE only to find however that <u>this place soon disappears</u>.<br>
<center>Winning as they know it wasn't really what they thought it was after all.</center>
<br>
Let us now make a major paradigm shift.  Let's look at another model of winning, one that is much different than the <u>Red One</u>.  It is -- the Blue Model.  The Blue Car travels a much different road than the Red Car's road to success.  This road is the <u>Success Road</u>.  The Blue Car has a totally different power source.  It is powered by personal achievement and the challenge of becoming one's best self and not by the Red Car's (comparison to others).  Excellence and winning in the competitive arena become by-products that happen because of the trip on the Success Road that the Blue Car travels.  By focusing on competing with one's best self, exciting things start to happen because they are now in control of -- <u>their point of effort</u>.<br>
<center><u>Desires and goals in life become more meaningful and attainable</u>.</center>
<br>
Driving the Blue Car on the Success Road diminishes the pitfalls of the Red Car on the Road to Success (tension, anxiety, fear and regret).  In their place merges a renewed confidence and well being that is developed through encouragement, positive self talk and the building of strong affirmations.  the desire to achieve steadily increases as one drives the Blue Car.  There are speed bumps, flat tires, and engine repair with the Blue Car, however, there in now meaning and purpose which gives direct control over the direction and intensity of an individual's point of effort.  Another exciting by-product is created on this trip -- the dynamic <u>Double Win</u>.  The Double Win is the brining out the best in oneself and others.  This brings joy into the competitive arena, raises performance levels and gives individuals a new awareness of personal worth in their lives.<br>
<br>
These are the two models of WINNING -- they have many significant differences.  You are now at the Y in the road.  Many of you did not know there was a Blue Car and a Success Road -- <u>now you do</u>.  You HAVE A CHOICE which car you drive and which road you will travel.  Winning in the Red Car on the Road to Success is getting something or getting some place.<br>
