Many have called this the <u>MAGIC WORD</u>, a word when really  understood can change you -- <u>FOR WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE YOU CHANGE YOUR LIFE</u>.  Our <u>ATTITUDE</u> actually is our habit of thought.  It is a reflection or mirror of our <u>SELF-IMAGE</u>.  Our <u>ATTITUDE</u> is the outside reflection of what is going on inside of us.  These thought patterns have a dominant effect on our feelings, which in turn controls our actions.
<br>
<br>
A <u>WINNING ATTITUDE LIFESTYLE</u> is one that gives you that desire to strive for <u>EXCELLENCE</u> and a <u>PURPOSE</u> for your life.  To start to develop this type of <u>ATTITUDE</u>, we must evaluate the dominant information in our sub-conscious mind.  We need to learn to revise and replace self-limiting negative thought patterns and renew and build new positive potential thought patters.  Our Logo-Conscious will then start to move us in that direction.  <u>ATTITUDE</u> change takes time and effort and most people either do not see the real pay value of it or continue to let outside forces affect their thinking and ego behavior patterns.  These people are like thermometers --
<Center>constantly being affected by outside forces -- up and down</center>
<br>
Building a <u>WINNING ATTITUDE</u> is like pumping water from a well with a hand pump -- it takes considerable time at first to get the water started to flow; in fact, sometimes you have to prime the pump.  After the water starts to flow it then takes just a gentle steady pumping motion to keep the water going.<br>
<br>
We spend many years of our lives in formal and informal education and yet never learn how to use and develop our own <u>WINNING ATTITUDE</u>.  We have this great acre of attitude diamonds and yet don't eve know it.  Search for them -- find them -- polish them, for the really are
<Center><u>THE DIAMONDS THAT LIGHT YOUR WORLD</u>.</center>
