<tr><Td><br><font size=5>This fall when you see geese heading south for the winter, flying along in "V" formation, you might be interested in knowing what science and psychology have discovered about why they fly that way.  It has been learned that as each bird flaps it wings, it creates an uplift for the bird immediately following.  By flying in a "V" formation, the whole flock adds at least 71% greater flying range than in each bird flew on its own.</font><Br><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><font size=5><Br>Whenever a goose falls out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and resistance of trying to go it alone, and quickly gets back into formation to take advantage of the lifting power of the bird immediately in front.  When the lead goose gets tired, he rotates back in the wing and another goode flies point.<br><br></font></td></tr>
