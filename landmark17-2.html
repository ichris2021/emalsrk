Illinois Linebacker Chuck Boreo -<br>
It's 1st down for Wisconsin on Illinois' one yard line.<br>
Do you know how far one yard is?<BR>
It can be the shortes thing when you have to defend it and the longest thing when you have to gain it.  Here is where the goin' gets tought and the tough really get going'.<br>
Boreo yells out to the Wisconsin quarter back, "Send Ameachee (their big fullback) at me."<br>
Do you get the impact of that?<br>
In other words he was confident and ready.<br>
Wisconsin did run Ameachee at Boreo - the result, a three-yard loss.  After four down the ball rested on teh Illinois 6-yard line.<br>
1 yard, 1 yard from doing it or not doing in. 1 yard, or 1 inch from being someone who has the guts to open the door to the challenges of life.<Br>
<center><u>KEEP THAT FIRE OF DESIRE IN YOUR HEART</u></center><br>
Eddie Bray, Illinois' small Def Back (5'9'' - 139 pounbs) had a big heart - a real big heart.  Eddie made one of the greates clutch open field tackles in Illinois history, tackling Notre Dame's All-American powerful fast running back, Jim Mello on teh five yard line on the last play of the game to preserve the one point victory and sen Illinois to the Rose Bowl.<Br><br>

What put the shoulders there?  Bones, muscle - no, it was a big heart - a desire - a will -<br>
<center>a never-say-die spirit<Br>
<u>REGARDLESS OF THE ODDS<BR>
TO GET THE JOB DONE</u></center><br>

Lou Budroe, Cleveland Indians baseball manager walks his talk of courage and confidence in this situation.  His team is behind by one run - two outs - last of the 9th - bases loaded.  The player at bat has a no ball two stike count on him.  Budroe calls time - puts himself in as a pinch hitter - Courage - Guts - Confidence - Regardless of the odds.  Hit the first pitch into center field driving in two runs to win the game.<br>
<center>DESIRE - WILL - SPIRIT.</center><Br>
<center><u>THE WILL TO WIN - ABE LINCOLN</u></center>
Tried 27 times to be elected to office - failed 25 times - THEN WON THE BIG ONE.  He still believed in himself  He had the - Desire - Will - Belief and Confidence to continue to compete.<Br><br>
Bing Crosby, the great singer, said, "You don't sing with your mouth - you sing with you heart.  It comes from the <u>heart of a man</u>."<BR><BR>

There are blind golfers that shoot in the 90's.  They can't see, yet when pointed in the right direction draw on their centering strength to get the job done - a will - a desire<br>

Illinois Captain Mel Brewer's mother died the week of the game.  Mel returned for the team meeting the night before the game.  As he stood to talk to the team he looked into each player's eyes - you could feel electricity in teh room.  <u>Something was going to happen, the belief, confidence and total release were there</u>.<br>
The next day, you could feel it in the pre-game locker room slowly building for the opening kick-off.  It was the same outer physical team but a different inner team.  The result took care of itself.<Br>
<center>DEDICATED - DETERMINED - DIRECTED<BR>
(Never Flinching)<BR>
THE WILL TO SUCCEED -<br>
REGARDLESS OF THE ODDS<br>

This is the beginning - the end and the in-between of football and life - that intangible spirit that separates people and teams and it all comes from<br><br>
