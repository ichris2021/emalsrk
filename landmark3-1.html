Do you get it?  I sure hope you GOT IT, for it is your attitude more than anything else that iwll affect the successful outcome of any of life's experiences.  And, it is your attitude toward life, which will determine life's attitude toward you.<br><br>
A fascingating way to show the power and significance of the BLUE CAR ATTITUDE is to write down a numverical alphabet (example A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on to Z=26).  Now take the word ATTITUDE and five each letter a numerical value.  Then add up the numbers for a total for the word.  Very intersitng isn't it?  Put a percent sign behind the number and you've got the message.  That's how important your attitude is.<br><br>
See those green rocks over there - pick some up, put them in your pouch and drive on.  you are now in the up-country and at a rest stop you find Landmark 3.  you take the <u>SRK</u> bag, sit under a tree, open it and <u>Lock on and Learn</u>.  (the <u>3 Sided Coin</u>)<br><br></font>
