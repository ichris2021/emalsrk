<font size=4>Three men started out on foot across the Makani Desert.  It was a two-day trip over deep loose sand and towering sand dunes that constantly shifted with the course of the wind.  Things went well on the first day as the men traveled many miles in spite of the intense heat and strong wind.  At twilight they reached a small oasis lined with tall palm trees.  It was the mid-point of their journey.  They were hot and tired but as they drank the cool water from the deep well and bathed in the small pool they were revived and refreshed.<br><br>
As darkness came, the tempurature dropped considerably and they built a warm fire near the edge of the pool.  After eating, they sat by the fire relaxing and talking.  A tall male figure in a white hooded robe appeared out of the darkness.  They didn't see him until he spoke.  His low voice was soft, firm and friendly.<br><br>
"GOOD EVENING," he said - the startled men reached for their rifles for they feared they were going to be robbed.  The man resumed speaking -<br><br>
"HAVE NO FEAR - I MEAN YOU NO HARM.  I HAVE SOME IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU THAT WILL MAKE <U>YOU GLAD AND SAD</u>."  The three men peered through the darkness to see who this man was.  They could only see the long white hooded robe, his riercing eyes, and the outline of his face.  The man continued -<br><br>
"WHEN YOU RISE IN THE MORNING, LOOK ACROSS TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE POOL AND YOU WILL SEE VARIOUS COLORED ROCKS.  PICK UP SOME OF EACH COLOR, PUT THEM IN A POUCH AND TIE THEM TO YOUR WAIST."  The three men looked puzzled but didn't say a word.<br>
The man kept on speaking -<br><br>
"CARRY THESE ROCKS WITH YOU UNTIL YOU REACH THE END OF THE DESSERT.  DO NOT TAKE THEM FROM YOUR WAIST AND DO NOT LOOK AT THEM UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETED YOUR JOURNEY.  WHEN YOU FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS, YOU WE BE BOTH<bR>
<CENTER><U>GLAD</U> AND <U>SAD</U>."</CENTER>
