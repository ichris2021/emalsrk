<tr><td><font size=4>Martial Arts is more than a system of fighting.  It's a system of thought.  You must out-think your opponent regardless who they are because some of them will try to fool you and make you believe they are nothing.<br><br>

We all have inner demons to fight.  These demons are Fear, Hatred and Anger.  If you don't conquer them<Br>
<center><i>then a life of 100 years is a tragedy.<Br>
If you do, a life of a single day can be a triumph.</i></center><Br>
The consciousness and awareness of yourself and your actions and reaction are the <u>greatest hindrances</u> to the proper execution of anything.  The knowledge and skill level you have and will attain (20/80 Rule) <u>must not be thought about</u>.  You must learn to apply this knowledge and skill every time by <u>GABIT</u>.  You then can maintain your focus on the <u>NOW</u> and be executing at Peak Performance Levels - this is the <u>FLOW STATE</u>.  You will reach this enlightened state when <u>you are able</u> to put out of your mind all you have learned (it is NOW IN YOUR SUB-CONSCIOUS MIND).  <u>You then act and react automatically every time</u>.<br><br>

Relaxtion is a key part of this.  It is essential for more powerful movements and hitting in any contact.  Let you lead move or hit shoot out quickly yet loosely and easily.  Don't flex your body or clench your fist until the moment of impact.  All hits should end with a <u>SNAP</u> several inches behind the target.<Br><br>

<u>The great mistake is to anticipate the outcome of any engagement</u>.  You are not to be thinking of whether it ends in victory or defeat.  Let nature take its course and you will strike at the right moment.  The result will take care of itself.</font></tD></tR>

<font size=3>See how water flows.<br>
Learn to be like water.<br>
Water is soft and flexible.<br>
It can fit into any container.<br>
It seems weak,<br>
But it can be powerfully strong.<br>
Be like the nature of water.<br><br>

Emotion can be the enemy.<br>
If you give in to emotion you can lose yourself.<br>
<u>Be at one</u> with your emotions.<br>
<u>Because the body always follows the mind</u>.<br>
It's not about winning.<Br>
It's about EXCELLENCE.<br>
Striving for perfection.

<td align=left width=350 valign=top><br>
<font size=3>It isn't size or strength that matters.<br>
It's focus -- We all have a <u>chee</u> -- an inner spirit.<Br>
Focus and there's nothing you cannot bend to your will.<br>
Little Ones can take down Big Ones.<br><br>
Martial Art's thought process changes people.<br>
You can't change people with force.<Br>
When people see something strange -- <Br>
Something they don't understand -<br>
They get afraid.<br>
Learn the beauty of that strange thing and you<br>
will no longer be AFRAID<br>
Becuase it's now become part of you.
