<ul>
<li><font size=4>We can't control what the other teams do to get ready.  We can control what we do to get ready!  <u>THIS IS THE KEY</u>!  (Millionaire Henry Ford never had a cadillac.  He didn't want one.  He wanted the best Ford car his company could make)<Br><Br></font></li>

<li><font size=4><u>Faling to prepare is preparing to fail</u>.  You always win when you do make a full effort to do the best you are capable of doing.  (The only person who knows this is you)  Did you win, did you lose are the wrong questions.  The question is -<br>
<center>DID I MAKE MY BEST EFFORT?  WAS MY BEST SHOT MY BEST?</center><Br></font></li>

<li><font size=4>The more "SUCCESSFUL" we are, the higher the EXPECTATIONS become from other suspicious people and when we don't do it as they think we should, the more criticism we receive.  Forget that red car stuff - Keep on driving our Blue Indy Car.  Stick to your journey - Stick to your beliefs.<br>
<center>OTHERS COME TO BEAT US, WE COME TO BE US.</center><Br></font></li>

<li><font size=4><u>THE FINAL SCORE IS NOT THE FINAL SCORE</u>.  The final score is how prepared you were to execute near your own level of EXCELLENCE both individually and as a team.<br>
<center>Remever the 60% - 30% - 10% Rule - Yesss!</center><Br></font></li>

<li><font size=4>When yo do lose on the scoreboard, it is only temporary and not all-encompassing.  You must simply <u>STUDY IT</u>, <u>LEARN FROM IT</u> and try hard not to lose the same way again.  Then you have the SELF-CONTROL to flush it, forget about it and move ahead on the Success Road.<BR><Br></font></li>

<li><font size=4>(John Wooden definition)  THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN ULTIMATELY JUDGE THE LEVEL OF YOUR SUCCESS IS YOU.<BR><Br></font></li>

<li><font size=4>Anything coming from scoreboard success is simply a <u>by-product</u>.  Strive to reach your personal best - which is what is under your control.<BR><Br></font></li>

<li><font size=4>(Winning) successful people are positive people - they keep the negative thought out - They are Tough Minded Optimists (refer to the artice).<BR><Br></font></li>

<li><font size=4>Constantly learn what you believe SUCCESS is all about.  Go over and over again the difference between the journey and the inn.<br>
<center>The Trip and the Destination.</center><Br></font></li>

<li><font size=4>The goal in life - <u>Give it your Best Shot always</u> - <u>and you are a Success</u>.  <u>PERIOD</u>.  Make the effort to do the best you are capable of doing (this is what you can control).  The effort is what counts in everything!<br>
<center>THE MAN IN THE ARENA - THAT IS THE SPOT - SO GO FOR IT NOW<bR>
<u>AND GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT</center></font></li>
