<tR><td align=center><font size=6 color=#ffffff>THE MAN IN THE GLASS</font><br><br>
<font size=4 color=#ffffff>When you've got what you want<br>
in your struggle for self<br>
and the world makes you KING for a day,<br>
just go the mirror and look at yourself,<br>
<i>and see what THAT man has to say.</i><br>
<br>
It isn't your parents or friends or your wife<br>
whose judgement upon you must pass:<br>
the fellow whose verdict counts the most<br>
in your life,<br>
<i>is the one staring back from the glass.</i><br>
<br>
Some people may think<br>
you're a straight-shootin' chum<br>
abd call you a wonderful guy.<br>
But the man in the glass says<br>
you're only a bum<br>
<i>if you can't look him straight in the eye.</i><br>
<br>
He's the fellow to please, never mind all the rest,<br>
for he's with you clear to the end.<br>
And you've passed your most dangerous<br>
and difficult test<br>
<i>if the man in the glass is your friend.</i><br>
<br>
You may fool the whole word<br>
down the pathway of years<br>
and get pats on teh back as you pass.<br>
But your final reward will be<br>
heartache and tears<br>
<i>if you've cheated the man in the glass.</i></font>
