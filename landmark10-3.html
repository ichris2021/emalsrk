<tr><td><br><font size=4>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA tough minded optimist is one who has what it takes to continue to lean to the positive through the many struggles of human life.  Life in so many ways is a truggle, but the Tough Minded Optimist sees it full of CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES and not full of problems and disappointments.  They believe their efforts can make a difference -- they see themselves and <u>ROWING</u> and not <u>DRIFTING</u> -- they may find themselves occasionally up the proverbial creek, but they've always got their <u>paddle</u>.<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe word "tough" is really a positive upbeat word.  We're not talking about the negative or downbeat connotation many people give it -- that of being cold, hard-boiled, blunt or hood-like.  We are talking about the positive upbeat definition of Tough -- Let's look at Webster's Dictionary definition -- it's a great one --</font><br><br></td></tr>

<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen you are Tough Minded you can counter the stresses in your life.  You can deal with frustration in a positive way and not break apart in your thought processes.  By being flexible and resilient you develop that "Hang Tought Attitude" and are able to overcome many obstacles and challenges.  An ancient proverb says it so well --<br><br></td></tr>

<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBeing Tough, however, is only part of the game -- to merely hold on is not enough.  To learn to think assertively and constructively, to be motivated to dream, desire and goal set, to think about what we want to happen and not what we don't want to happen; to continually think about areas of strength rather than areas of weakness; to think about desires rather than fears.<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo attack, overcome and achieve brings excitement into our life.  Thus, we add the word "optimist" -- here again is a word that many people have given an unrealistic, superficial definition.  We are not talking about the super-cheery, ultra bright pie in teh sky connotation optimism has been given; we are talking about having the ability to see reality at its worst and yet continue to believe in teh best possible outcome in each situation.  Webster's definition again is a beauty --<br><br></td></tr>

<Td width=385 align=left>
<font size=4 color=blue>The doctrine that the goods inlife overbalance the pain and evil in it, that life is preponderantly good.  The inclination to put the most favorable construction upon actions and happenings, minimize adverse aspects, conditions and possibilities, or anticipate the best possible outcome; an enthusiastic and hopeful temperament.

<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe ability to think and believe like this is the high energy fuel in the tank of our invisible psychic engine that gives us that peace and power to do exceedingly well in the many aspects of the game of life.<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe <u>TOUGH MINDED OPTIMIST</u> actually attracts success for they know and understand that life is just like a batting average (the .333 hitter).  They learn to have more fun in the natural highs of life and are always looking for oppurtunities to care and share with others.<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe have a model of the greatest <u>TOUGHT MINDED OPTIMIST</u> of all times in our <u>LORD JESUS CHRIST</u>.  He has inspired more people than anyone else in the history of mankind to make something out of their lives.  He teaches them to challenge their own best selves and not compare themselves to others, to learn to take calculated risks, to put up and support others and to reach out in life and really <u>GO FOR IT</u>!
