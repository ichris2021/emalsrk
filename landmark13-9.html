<Tr><Td><font size=4>It is the belief in a different model of winning;  that is, winning is a by-product of achievement developing into excellence.<bR>
(Joshua 1:7 - Success)<Br><br>
It is the belief in the expectation of achievment and excellence.<br>
(Phil. 4:6-9 - Peace, Power and Joy)<br><br>
It is the belief that the finest way to help a player, a team or a coaching staff achieve excellence is to continually focus our challenges on our best self.  This is accomplished through coaching and interacting with our staff, individual coaching of one's self and the individual coaching of each other.  It is the true closing of the potential performance gap.  This is ehre the control is.<Br>
(Gal. 6:4 - You vs. You)<br>
(Rom. 8:37 - More than Conquerors)<br><Br>
It is the belief that the only true motivation is through love and caring; not through fear, intimidation or incentive.<br>
(I John 4:18,19 - There is no fear in LOVE)<br>
This is the building of trust.  Tough love is a part of this - it is not always pleasant, and must be done in the right way; but it is necessary for true relationships to grow and excellence to emerge.<Br><br>
It is the belief in the development of genuine team leadership; which begins with the coaching staff, the captains, the unit leaders on the team and total team members.<br>
(Acts 2:44,45 - The true servant warriors)<bR><br>
It is the belief that our coaching philosophy and coaching style is based on these six key principles.  It is the desire to continually goalset to strive for consistency in applying these principles to our coaching and the building of our football program.
