<tr><td><font size=4>One key qulity that all people with <u>WINNING ATTITUDES</u> have is that of being a <u>SELF-STARTER</u>.  They continually learn to --- <u>HIT THEIR OWN HOT BUTTON</u>!  They know how to fish and don't wait around to be given a fish.  They have learned to use and apply <u>the strongest force there is for self-motivation --- GOAL SETTING</u>.  <u>GOAL SETTING</u> is directly related to an individual's <u>DREAMS, VISIONS and DESIRES</u>.  Individuals who are <u>SELF-STARTERS</u> have also learned to reach out, learn from others, and seek mentoring assistance from those they respect.  They then utilize this new information in any way possible in their pursuit of <u>EXCELLENCE</u>.<br><br>
A <u>SELF-MOTIVATED INDIVIDUAL</u> develops another key quality in this area -- that of <u>SELF-DISCIPLINE</u>.  A quality that directs many of the <u>prior choices in their lives</u>.<br><br>
<u>VISUALIZATION</u> also palys a major role in a <u>SELF-STARTING INDIVIDUAL</u>.
<center><b>The one essential fact continually emerges that one person, like <u>YOU</u>, can --- <br>really make a difference.</center></font></td></tr>
