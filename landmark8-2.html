They affirm and encourage them from the sidelines as well as give them tips on their positions.  They are SERVANT WARRIORS th them and when the roles are reversed, each player responds accordingly.  This is what gives our team so much VIM-VIGOR and VITALITY -- the unselfish sharing we give to each other.  This is what created MOMENTUM and the DOUBLE WIN (bringing out the best in ourselves and each other).  The Golds, All Blacks, Bombers and the coaching staff all share in this powerful combination.</font></td></tr>

<font size=5>Every individual player on our team is important and has a role.  Remember Anthony's captain's letter last summer (the typewriter with on key not working).  We all give worth and value to each other.  All Blacks and Bombers give theie role, their best shot and enjoy the successes of their teammates.</font><Br><br>

<font size=5>To bring out the best in each other we show a genuine interest in our teammates.  We make the time to get to know each other.  This quality is caring -</font>
