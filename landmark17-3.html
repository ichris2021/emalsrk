<tr><td><font size=5 color=#ffffff><center>YOUR STATE OF MIND</center></font><Br>
<font size=4 color=#ffffff>If you think you can, you can<br>
If you think you dare not, you don't<br>
If you think you can't, but really can<br>
It's almost a cinch you won't<br><Br>
For out in this world, you will find<bR>
Success begins with a person's will<Br><Br>
<Center>It's all in your state of mind</center><br>
Many a game is lost before ever a play is run<br>
And many a coward falls before his work begin<br><Br>
Think big and your deeds will grow<br>
Think small and you'll fall behind<br>
Think you can and you will<br><br>
<center>It's all in your state of mind</center><br>
If you think you're outclassed, you are<br>
You've got to think high to rise<br>
You've got to be a little sure of yourself<br>
Before you can ever win a prize<br><br>
For life's victories don't always go<br>
To the stronger, faster or smarter man<br>
But sooner or later, the fellow how wins<br><br>
<center>Is the fellow who thinks he can.
