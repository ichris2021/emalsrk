<li>The more "SUCCESSFUL" you are, the higher and higher the EXPECTATIONS become, the more suspiciuos people are of you, and the more criticism you receive - stick to your journey - stick to your beliefs.<br><br></li>

<li>A true competitor gets the most joy out of the most difficult circumstances.<br><br></li>

<li>You need to understand the 60 - 30 - 10 rule.  (60% of the time you beat yourself, 30% of the time your opponent palys on a higher level and 10% of the time momentum makes the difference).  It's the key to higher level of performance.<br>During the week of the game ways you beat yourself --<br>
Lack of desire to prepart to be your best self through goal sets in the following areas:<br>
Attitud -- Skills + Systems -- Fitness -- Team Building<br><br>

Being aware of how you beat yourself during the game --<br>
Penalties -- Turnovers -- Busted Assignments<br>
Breakdown in Fundamentals -- Poor Choices<Br>
Getting Caught in the Trap of Playing Psych games<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(Distract - Intimidate - Provoke - Pretense)<br>
These are all in your control.<br><br></li>

<li>Why players and teams succeed (Example of the Car)<br>
Every part needed - Every part important<br>
Engine, steering wheel, brakes (top players)<Br>
Wheels and Tires (palying support players)<br>
Lug Nuts hold on weels on (Non playing and Bomber) support players<br><br></li>

<li>Everyone on the team is equally important to the team.  <u>Each Has a Role</u>.  Develop All-American Butlers as well as outstanding starting and backup players.<br><br></li>

<li>Second, third, fourth verse same as the first.  Hard work with a purpose, and I mean hard work does pay dividends.  Repetition -- meaningful repetition.  20/80 Rule.<br><br></li>

<li>DETAILS + DETAILS + DETAILS - it's what sets successful people apart.<br><br></li>

<li>Let's get as close as we can to closing our potential - performance <u>GAP</u>.  GAP -- Goal Setting -- Positive Attitude Building -- Persistence -- Perserverance<br>
<center>(These are the keys)</li>
