<ul>
<li>You can only give waht you have to close your potential-performance GAP.<br>
THE KEY IS TO GIVE IT ALL.<br><br></li>

<li>You may not be big-fast-quick<br>
<Center><u>but you can play Big-Fast-Quick</u>!  Yesss you can.<br><br>
You don't have to measure up<br><u>but you sure can play up</u>!  Yesss you can.</center><br></li>

<li>When you hurry, you tend to make mistakes, on the other hand if you can't execute quickly you may be too late to accomplish your task.  IT'S A DELICATE BUT CRUCIAL BALANCE<br>
<Center>(<u>ACT QUICKLY - BUT DON'T HURRY</u>)</center><br></li>

<li>How can you be successful?<br>
Enjoy HARD WORK.  The secret is - there is no secret.<br>
IT IS THE LOVE OF HARD WORK - WITH PURPOSE - 20/80 Rule<br>
<Center>THAT'S THE PRICE YOU MUST PAY<BR>FOR THE PRICE IS RIGHT</center><br></li>

<li>The time to prepare isn't after you've been given the opportunity.  It's long before the opportunity arrives - once the opportunity arrives, it's too late to prepare.<br><br></li>

<li>So Enjoy the Preparation -<br>
<center>ENJOY THE PRACTICES - PAY AND ENJOY THE PRICE</center><br></li>

<li><u>SLOW AND STEADY GETS YOU READY</u> - When you improve a little each day, eventually big things occur.<Br>
<Center>DON'T LOOK FOR BIG QUICK IMPROVEMENTS -<BR>
SEEK THE SMALL IMPROVEMENTS ONE DAY AT A TIME.</center><br></li>

<li><u>Failing to prepare to fail</u>.  You always win when you do make a full effort to do the best you are capable of doing.  (The only person who knows this is you.  Did you win, did you lose are the wrong questions.)  The questions is -<br>
<center>DID I MAKE MY BEST EFFORT?  WAS MY BEST SHOT MY BEST?</center><br></li>

<li>We can't control what the other teams do to get ready.  We can control what we do to get ready!<br>
<u>THIS IS THE KEY</u>!  (Millionaire Henry Ford never had a Cadillac)<br>
He didn't want one.  He wanted the best Ford car his company could make.<br><br></li>

<li>Emotions - Getting fired up for games (Not too high - Not too low)<br>
No Game Face.  Balance is the most important word for a player or coach to keep in mind - <br>
<Center>Emotional, Physical, Mental, Spiritual - Individual - Team</center><br></li>

<li>Cervantes wrote:  The <u>journey is better than the inn</u>!  I derive my greatest satisfaction out of the preparation - the journey day after day - week after week, year after year.  (The score, the trophy is simply the inn.)<br><br></li>

<li><u>THE FINAL SCORE IS NOT THE FINAL SCORE.</u><br>
The final score is how prepared you were to execute near your own level of EXCELLENCE both individually and as a team.<Br>
<center>Remember the 60% - 30% - 10% Rule - Yesss!</center><br></li>

<li>When you do lose on scoreboard, it is only temporary and not all encompassing.  You must simply <u>STUDY IT, LEARN FROM IT</u> and try hard not to lose the same way again.<br>
<center>Then you have the SELF-CONTROL to FLUSH IT and forget about it.</center><br></li>

<li>(Winning) successful people are positive people - they keep the negative thougths out - They are Tough Minded Optimists (Remember the article)  John Wooden is a realist optimist!  You become an optimist through proper preparation and attention to detail.<bR>
<center>Idealism + Realism + Hard Work - <u>PAY AND ENJOY THE PRICE</u>!<br>
<u>For the Price is Right</u>.</center><br></center><br></li>

<li>Peace of Mind - Success is peace of mind that is the direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did the best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.<br><br></li>

<li>THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN ULTIMATELY JUDGE THE LEVEL OF YOUR SUCCESS IS YOU.<br><br></li>

<li>Anything coming from that success is simply a <u>by-product</u>.  Strive to reach your personal best - which is what is under your control - when you achieve that you have achieved success.  <u>PERIOD</u>.</li>
