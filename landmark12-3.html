<tr><td><font size=4>Be committed to EXCELLENCE.  Work hard to close the potential performance gap in each area in yourself and your teammates.  SUCCESS in the arena is a by-product of what you do -- it happens because of your commitement to EXCELLENCE -- THE OUTCOME TAKES CARE OF ITSELF -<br>
<Center>Gal 6:4 is the real game -- you vs. you</center><br>

Learn to play in the <u>NOW</u>!  It's this play, this down, this specific situation that's happening.  <u>Realize your mind always has a tendancy to wander</u>.  Keep a STONG FOCUS on the NOW -- this is what you can control -- not that last play or the next play but <u>this play</u>.  Be alert, yet relaxed with you MIND + EYES + BODY + SPIRIT -- You will start to see more, hear more, feel more, respond more and do more.<br><Br>

Build a STONG FUNDAMENTAL skill and system base.  You need to act and react quickly by habit.  You must learn to EXECUTE them on time -- every time.  Don't concern yourself with what you can't control -- FOCUS on the FLOW of the present (the now).  (Be like water -- flowing and flexible, yet strong and forceful.)  Act and react to each situation with high effectiveness.  Learn and execute you position fundamental at a high level.  Know your sustems inside out -- so you are at the right place at the right time.  <u>You can learn this and you can do it</u>.<br><br>

Love the competitive experience -- the tougher the challenge the more your should enjoy it.  When you believe and feel this wya the classic one liner happens -- <u>when the goin' gets tough, you get going'</u>.<br><br>

Flush the Red Car (thinking).  It isn't the physical advantage (size, strength, speed) that makes the plays -- It's your FOCUS and FUNDAMENTALS that give you the edge.<br>
<center><u>PLAY IN THE NOW</u>!</center><BR>
<Center>IT'S NOT THE SIZE OF THE DOG IN THE FIGHT,<BR>
IT'S THE SIZE OF THE FIGHT IN THE DOG.</center><br>

Know that your body follows your mind and your spirit.  These respond to the <u>cues</u> that you need to consistently give them.  If you don't give yourself positive cues and geedback, you will receive mostly critical and negative cues from the Red Car mindset that always tries to take over and from other outside sources.<br><br>
Your <u>key cues</u> are in the form of<br>
A.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPositive self talk on doing it and not doing it<br>
B.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStrong affirmations on peak performance and total release<br>
C.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVivid visualization on peak performance and total release<br>
D.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOutward encouragement to yourself and to you teammates and coaches.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou need to use these tools (<u>cues</u>) extensively to build your performance for:  -- <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<u>Your Performance Will Mirror Your Thought Patterns</u><br><Br>
Continuously picture yourself in your mind's eye (mental, spiritual, and physical qualitites).  See and feel yourself being -- FOCUES -- CALM -- CONFIEDNT -- READY -- QUICK -- COURAGEOUS + HIGH ENERGY + TOTAL RELEASE.<Br>
<Center><u>There can be a definite transfer here to your performance</u>.</center><br>

Emjoy the preparation for the competitive event.  Pay and enjoy the price of practices and team get togethers.<br>
<centeR><u>The price is an eager mindset and hard work - LOVE TO GET READY</u>!</center><br>

Accept the responsibility for your own mistakes or for just not doing it.  Learn from them, flush them and bouce back from them in a resilient manner.<br>
<center>(<u>The classic nut in the jar</u>)</center><br>

Know that teams and individuals succeed by taking calculated risks along the way.  Be alert and poised for any opportunity and then act quickly to take advantage of any situation.  There are times yo ucan make things happen that can keep or change the momentum of the game.<br>
<center><u>GET AND KEEP BIG MO ON OUR SIDE</u></center><br>

Love to play the game for the pleasure of playing and the challenges the competitive esperience brings.  Yo may be in a support role rather than on the field.  You need to understand that clutch players can also contribute from the sidelines.<br><br>
Know the sum will come up in the morning whether you did it or not, whether we won or lost the game on the scoreboard.<br><br>
Remever the final score is not the final score to the Clutch Player -- He loves to reload and keep giving it his best shot -- the joy is in the playing.

<tr><td><br><font size=4>There are those players who possess many of the 11 Rules and Tools of Clutch Players but do not believe or are not aware of the relevance or the relationship of the Spiritual Dimension for Peak PErformance.  They play from within themselves at a high level with a close gap in their Potential Perfromance much of the time.  Many times these players are at their Best when the game is on the line.<br><br>
There are also other players who possess the 11 Rules and Tools of Clutch Players who do believe the Spiritual Dimension is the true key basis for Peak Performance.  they have identified these 11 with the Biblical qualities of Total Release.  They hav let go of their self image and play though their fatih and relationship with Jesus Christ.  this gives them a peace, power and joy (PHIL 4:6-7) and a resilient power bast (1 JOHN 4:4,18,19) to excel at a high level.  Many times these players are at their Best when the game is on the <u>line</u>.  Total Release has become their life style.<br><br>
Each type of these players are Clutch Players.  However, they are each using a different power source.<br></font></td></tr>
