You notice right away that the road begins in this beautiful park where you are now standing.  It the goes for a considerable distance into the foothills and through the up-country.  The road then elevates into the majestic mountains and ascends to the upper snow capped ranges.  It then winds down the mountain terrain to the lower elevations and out to the coast to the magnificent scenic ocean drive.  What a spectacular trip this is going to be.

As you look at your map you see the 1<font size=2>st</font> landmark is located close to t where you are standing.  You look up and see to your left two large trees and between them is the 1<font size=2>st</font> <u>SRK</u> landmark.  You go over to it, and sure enough, beneath it is a small black and gold athletic bag with <u>SRK</u> on it.  You take the bag, sit down on the grass by the lake, open it and <u>Lock and Learn</u> from the two narratives (Models of Winning) (The Station).
