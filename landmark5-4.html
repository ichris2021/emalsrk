<tr><td><font size=4 face=Times New Roman>It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcomings, who knows the great devotion, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the high achievement or triumph and who at worst, if he fails while daring greatly, knows his place shall never be with those timid and cold souls who know neither victory nor defeat.</font></td></tr>

<tr><td><br><font size=3>The above is one of the most impressive and impacting philosophies I have ever heard.  It was a thought expressed by one of the greatest competitors of our time, Theodore Roosevelt, our twenty-sixth President.  It embodies my basic feelings as to what success is really all about.  The same philosophy applies to just about every phase of one's life.  The common thread of thought for people in our sports world is to always try, try, and try again...to know in your heart that you did your best.  Then, if victory does come, you will know that you made a very special contribution.</font></td></tr>
