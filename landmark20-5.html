<tr><td><font size=4>The sun was now setting in the west and there would only be about two more hours of daylight.  The men continued to move on, grumbling and growling at the man with the rocks.  Coming to the top of another large sand dune they looked and saw in the distance a small town at the end of the desert.  It was about an hour away. This energized all of them for they now knew they could complete their journey before dark.<br><br>
They arrived at the outskirts of the town at twilight - exhausted and about ready to drop, yet happy that they had completed their desert journey successfully.  They came to serveral large palm trees, stopped, and unloaded their gear.  Both men began laughing hysterically at the man with the rocks for he had been limping badly over the last mile and his leg had begun to bleed.  He looked into their eyes, untied the pouch from his waist, dropped to his knees and emptied the contents on the ground.<Br><br>
The other two men were both stunned and shocked.  To their utter amazement and disbelief they saw the rocks had turned into precious gems!  The white ones were diamonds, the blue ones sapphires, the red ones rubies, the green ones emeralds, the black ones onyx and teh multi-colored ones opals.  They looked at each other and recalled what the man in the white robe had told them -<br><br>
<center>"FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS AND YOU WILL BE<BR><U>GLAD</u> --- and <u>SAD</u>."<br><br>
The two men who hadn't, were sad -- very, very sad.<br>
The other man who did, was glad -- very, very glad<br>
but he was also sad,<br><br>
</font><font size=6>because<br>
<u>he hadn't picked up more rocks</u>!</center></font><br></TD></TR>
