<tr><Td><br><font size=4>Each on of us has a sizable <u>GAP</u> is what we can be (our POTENTIAL) and what we are now (our PRESENT PERFORMANCE).  A Clutch Player, however, is decidedly different.  They are the ones who consistently perfomr at a high level in their competitive arena with a very small GAP between their POTENTIAL and THEIR PERFORMANCE.  They are alert and poised to take advantage of any oppurtunity to gain the advantage and to make things happen.  They also have that SPECIAL QUALITY to close their gap even further and rise to the occasion near the end of a game.  They are (by definition)<br>

<Center></font><Br><font size=5 color=blue><u>The Strange Secret</u></font></center><br>
<font size=4>Why are there so few clutch players?  The major reason is because the greatest number of players do not know the <u>strange secret</u> to becoming one.  This secret gives a player an advantage in many game situations --<br>
<Center><u>to make a difference in the outcome of the game</u>.</center><br>

So, what is this secret that changes players' level of performance so dramatically?  -- HERE IT IS!<br><br>
The secret is -- <U></font><font color=gold size=4>THERE IS NO SECRET</u></font><font size=4>!  It has been there in front of us all the time but we didn't reconize it.  (Remember the acres of diamonds story.)<br><br>
After years of listening, talking, reading, studying and praying, I realized it was right there in front of me.  It has been around for ages and has been the basis for all the Martial Arts and yet is has not been accepted or given much credibility in the many other athletic arenas of American Sport.  What we are talking about is<br>
<center></font><font size=4 color=gold><u>THE TREMENDOUS POWER OF THE INNER GAME.</u></center></font><br><Br>
<Center><font size=5 color=blue><u>Just Do It</u></font></center><br>
<font size=4>The greatest majority of coaches and players believe that you do -- <u>JUST DO IT</u>!  For that is the only model that they have every known.  They spend 90% or even more of their time with physical prepartation for the so called <u>WAR GAMES</u> in the arena.  Football is a physical game and they want to be <u>ready</u>!  These coaches and their players have bought the NIKE Red Car model mindset of competition.  (You don't win</font><font size=4 color=silver> silver</font>, <font size=4>you lose </font><font size=4 color=gold>gold</font><font size=4>) -- A NIKE Billboard at the Olympics -- it's the old number one or no one game.  NIKE has since tried to temper their approach with the I CAN commercial, however they still have that </font><font size=4 color=red><u>Red Car mindset</u>.<br><br><br></font>
<Center><font size=5 color=blue><u>A Different Paradigm</u></font></center><br>
<font size=4>Now let's <u>STOP + LOOK + LISTEN</u>.  There is another excellenct model to be aware of.  We really need to know and understand much more about this model and how it contributes to high level team and individual performance.  We don't just do it as most coaches and players think -- if we do, we go up and down like a yo-yo experienceing many tensions, frustrations, doubts and regrets.  (Remember the story of the Little guy and Big guy chopping down trees.)  That's right, you don't just do it.<br><br>
Let's move to a new model, a different paradigm that sees high level physical performance in the arena actually as a BY-PRODUCT.  It happens because of other powerfully important qualitites other than just the physical.  A majority of psychologists agree that </font><font size=4 color=gold><u>we become waht we believe and think about</u></font><font size=4>.  It has been shown that 80% of SUCCESS in any given field actually depends on an individual or team's </font><font size=4 color=gold><u>Mental Attitude -- Mental Toughness</u></font><font size=4> and </font><font size=4 color=gold><u>Inner Game Preparation through Goal Setting</u></font><font size=4>.<br><br>
This is the secret that has been known in different forms for ages but has been overlooked, rejected put down or thrown away (The story of the TOUCHSTONE).  The high level physical performance actually results from genuine Inner Game Prepartation working hand in hand with the physical preparation.  This makes a player, a team and a coach <u>REALLY READY TO BE IN THE ARENA</u> and to take advantage of ordinary and extra ordinary things that are happening around them.  (The story of the Martial Arts Black Belt master and his four grandsons).<br><br><br>
<Center></font><font size=5 color=blue><u>11 on 11</u></font></center><br>
<font size=4>Action research has shown that there are 11 rules and tools that are the basis of the Inner Game -- These can be compared to the 11 players on the football field that play together as a team.  </font><font size=4 color=blue><u>Not the 11 best but the Best 11</font></u><font size=4>.  That's what these Rules and Tools are -- <u>The best 11</u>!  <u>Clutch players have learned, understand, believe and daily apply these top 11 to their lives</u>.  This is what gives them the edge, that ability to take advantage of any situation to make things happen -- they look and see more, they listen and hear more, they are aware and feel more and they respond quickly to do more time after time after time.<Br><br><br>
<center></font><font size=5 color=blue><u>What Is Being Ready</u></font></center><br>
<font size=4>There are approximately 160 play situations in a college football game.  In any close game there are only three (3) to four (4) plays that really make a difference in the outcome of the game.  The only problem is you never know when these plays will come.  The Clutch Player knows this and thus goes all out and gives his best shot on each and every play for that play could be the one.  There are many plays that appear to be ordinary plays, however all of a sudden the Big One Comes and The Clutch Player is ready -- It could be the first play or the last play of the game or any play in between.  (Read MATT 25:1-13, Jesus' parable of the 10 bridesmaids -- it's a great story about being ready).<Br><br><br>
<center></font><font size=5 color=blue><u>The Price</u></font></center><br>
<font size=4>The following are the Top 11 Inner Game Rules and Tools of Clutch Players.  Now there is a price to pay for them and the price is: An </font><font size=4 color=blue><u>Eager Mindset and the Love of Hard Work</font></u><font size=4>.  (There is no free lunch.  Remember the story of the Kind and his three wise men).  SImpe to understand but not easy to do, </font><font size=4 color=blue><u>the pay value for these 11 is Big Time</font></u><font size=4> and it gives you the love of preparation and the excitement of competing in the arena of both football and life.<br><br><br>
<center></font><font size=5 color=blue><u>The Power</u></font></center><br>
<font size=4>Now if you really hunger to become a Clutch Player you must use the greatest gift God has given (you) us all -- </font><font size=4 color=gold><u>This gift is the power of choice</font></u><font size=4>.  you must choose to become one to learn, understand, believe and apply these 11 to your lifestyle.  Believe me when you do you will start to enjoy the price and your best shot will start getting better and better and yes, as we believe as a team -- 
<Center></font><font size=4 color=blue><u>the longer we play -- the better we get</font></u><font size=4>.</center>
